# CLI Command History

## `make build`

The "make build" command compiles and builds the source code of a project according to the specifications in the Makefile.

## `ct dump 2`

The "ct dump 2" command is not a standard CLI command, but it appears to be related to the Erlang Common Test framework, where "ct" likely stands for Common Test and "dump 2" might be dumping test data or results, possibly from a specific test suite or node.
