# CLI Command History

## `make build`

The "make build" command compiles and builds the source code of a project according to the specifications in the Makefile.

## `ct dump 2`

The "ct dump 2" command is not a standard CLI command, but based on context, it might be related to the Erlang Common Test framework, where "ct" stands for Common Test and "dump" could be used to dump test data, with "2" potentially specifying a particular test or verbosity level.
